### About me
I'm highly motivated to obtain new knowledge and experience in the field of front-end development. Besides, I intend to go beyond and study salesforce development in the near future.
I consider as a competitive edge my level of English, which allows me to study all the necessary documentation.

I'm aware that soft skills are also essential for developers, and my previous work experience enabled me to acquire the following: 
* teamwork
* negotiation
* sociability
* initiative
* empathy
